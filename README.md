🚀 Advanced Java GUI Calculator – Project Features Explained
This project is a feature-rich scientific calculator built using Java Swing with a stylish interface via the JTattoo Look and Feel library. It combines basic arithmetic with advanced scientific, memory, and customization options.

🔢 Basic Arithmetic Operations
The calculator supports:

Addition (+)

Subtraction (-)

Multiplication (*)

Division (/)

These can be performed using intuitive buttons and text displays.

🧮 Scientific & Advanced Functions
Power (x^y) – Raises one number to the power of another.

Root (n√x) – Calculates nth root of a number.

Square (x²) – Squares the input.

Square Root (√x) – Computes square root.

Factorial (x!) – Computes factorials.

1/x – Calculates the reciprocal.

Percentage (%) – Finds percentages.

📐 Trigonometric Operations
sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)

Supports degree/radian mode switching (deg button)

🧠 Memory Functions
M+, M-, M*, M/ – Perform arithmetic with memory.

MS – Memory Store

MR – Memory Recall

MC – Memory Clear

These let users store results and reuse them in later operations.

📁 History Management
Every operation (Value1, Operator, Value2, Result) is recorded in a JTable.

Users can view, scroll, and delete history.

Helps in reviewing previous calculations.

🔐 Admin Mode (Password Protected)
Password field and ADMIN button allow restricted access.

Certain advanced options or configurations may be protected (you can customize this further).
