🚀 Advanced Java GUI Calculator – Project Features Explained

This project is a feature-rich scientific calculator built using Java Swing with a stylish interface via the JTattoo Look and Feel library. It combines basic arithmetic with advanced scientific, memory, and customization options.

⸻

🔢 Basic Arithmetic Operations

The calculator supports:
	•	Addition (+)
	•	Subtraction (–)
	•	Multiplication (×)
	•	Division (÷)

These can be performed using intuitive buttons and text displays.

⸻

🧮 Scientific & Advanced Functions
	•	Power (x^y) – Raises one number to the power of another
	•	Root (n√x) – Calculates nth root of a number
	•	Square (x²) – Squares the input
	•	Square Root (√x) – Computes square root
	•	Factorial (x!) – Computes factorials
	•	Reciprocal (1/x) – Calculates the reciprocal
	•	Percentage (%) – Finds percentages

⸻

📐 Trigonometric Operations
	•	sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)
	•	Supports degree/radian mode switching using the deg button

⸻

🧠 Memory Functions
	•	M+, M–, M*, M/ – Perform arithmetic with memory
	•	MS – Memory Store
	•	MR – Memory Recall
	•	MC – Memory Clear

These functions allow storing and recalling values efficiently.

⸻

📁 History Management
	•	Every operation (Value1, Operator, Value2, Result) is recorded in a JTable
	•	View, scroll, and delete previous entries
	•	Helpful for reviewing past calculations

⸻

🔐 Admin Mode (Password Protected)
	•	Password field and ADMIN button enable restricted access
	•	Advanced options or settings can be protected (optional/customizable)

⸻

🎨 Custom GUI Options
	•	ON/OFF Functionality: Enable or disable the calculator interface
	•	Theme Settings Panel (JTattoo):
	•	Customize colors and appearance
	•	Options for background, buttons, and more
	•	Includes Settings, Apply, and Option Colour controls

⸻

📏 Resizable Modes

Available via the Menu Bar:
	•	Standard Calculator
	•	Scientific Calculator
	•	History View

Each mode resizes the application window accordingly.

⸻

🖥️ Modern GUI using Java Swing + JTattoo
	•	Built using javax.swing with NetBeans GUI builder
	•	Stylish interface powered by JTattoo Look & Feel
	•	Includes styled buttons, tooltips, and interactive displays

⸻

🔄 Other Functionalities
	•	AC (All Clear) and C (Clear Entry)
	•	+/- Toggle – Switch between positive/negative
	•	Backspace – Delete last digit
	•	Decimal (.) – For floating-point inputs
	•	ENTER – Execute operation based on selected function

⸻

🛠️ Technical Requirements
	•	Java JDK 8+
	•	NetBeans IDE (recommended for GUI editing)
	•	JTattoo.jar – Must be added to classpath

⸻

✅ Summary

This calculator isn’t just functional—it’s user-friendly, visually customizable, and a great learning project combining Swing UI, event handling, memory operations, and advanced logic.
